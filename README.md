# Ready to Challenge Yourself?

Welcome to the codebase for the interactive examples! This code base has 20 different React examples you can use to practice your react skills for personal learning or interview practice. Most of these challenges are geared towards beginners and should be easy to solve within 15-30 minutes. Some of more intermediate and might take longer to solve. If you enjoyed checking out the code for these challenges, checkout the paid course I created with over 6 hours of walkthrough videos explaining how to solve these challenges:
